So shhh:). I'm excited cause they are such a great couple, and go figure, a great \"Match\" haw haw. My only hesitatation about the whole online concept is I'm not into serial dating or guys who are. I think the term serial dating is funny, but only because it's kinda the next thing to speed dating! I value monogomy and can not date a guy who has a history of infidelity. It's a deal breaker :( I also am not into the analytical, deep, philosophical type. Snore.  I'd rather laugh at stupid Youtube videos or watch any of the really good shows out there right now. I hope that doesnt come off as superficial but I tend to disagree with guys who are looking for a girl that can challenge their opinions or hold a good debate. Thats why we have lawyers, politicians, and... doctors! I think committed, exclusive relationships that have a balanced sense of expectations are the key to long-term happiness. That being said, I'm not on this site with an all-out intention to fall head over heels, though if that happend that would be great.

Pretty scary move, but without risk there is no reward right?  I went to school up in New Hampshire, so I used to frequent Boston quite a bit, but am trying to reacquaint myself again as it has been awhile.  Also still trying to get used to the T...it kinda blows.  I currently reside in Braintree, but am moving closer to the city, in March or April.  I would describe myself as a nice, laid back, go with the flow kind of girl.  You can pretty much put me in any social situation and I'll make it out alive...and probably with a new friend.  Ninety percent of the time you'll find me smiling or laughing (often at myself) because if you're not having fun, then what's the point?  Obviously there are some exceptions, and I do have a serious side, but for the most part I like to keep a pretty sunny disposition.  I also have an uncontrollable (and often inappropriate) habit of laughing at people falling.  I can't help it, it just happens.  The grape lady gets me every time.   I have a really great support system in both my friends and family.  I have two older brothers who I am very close with that live in NYC and my parents migrated down south when they retired and now legitimately have a more active social life than I do.  Pathetic, I know.  And although they are a bit further away these days, it just makes for more fun visits/trips to look forward to.  And my friends mean the absolute world to me.  I've been really lucky in landing some real keepers.  I'm pretty active, I've played tennis my whole life and have played pretty much every other recreational sport you can think of.  I like to run and I really, really want to do a Tough Mudder sometime in the near future.  I (like pretty much every other person on here) like going out for drinks and being social, but definitely appreciate a night in with some wine and good company.  Find me a bar where you can play Keno and you'll have me at hello.  Or trivia.  I love trivia.  I also like to cook and just recently started on a pretty serious baking kick, which I love, but am running out of people to pawn my treats off to.  Anyway, I guess that's about it, or at least the basics.  So if any of this interests you, feel free to email me...or don't, but do me a favor, don't text me, it's gay.
